# 🌟 Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my **Public Portfolio Repository**, a curated space where I showcase the projects, code, and experiments I've worked on — both academically and professionally.  

This repository serves as a collection of my learning journey, technical growth, and contributions made during my time in academics and office work. Every file and folder reflects not just code, but also the curiosity and effort behind solving real-world problems.
